# OPACA Dummy Services Container

This package contains a simple demo- and test-setup that can be used for demoing Reallabor-like services in OPACA. 

All the services in this module correspond to actual services in the ZEKI Reallabor, using the same action names and parameters, but returning either hardcoded or random values, so they can be used as stand-ins for testing or demoing when the real Reallabor services are not available.
