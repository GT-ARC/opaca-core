    <h1>OPACA Runtime Platform</h1>
    <p>
        You are seeing the "landing page" of the OPACA Runtime Platform. <br /> <strong>Please visit <a href="swagger-ui/index.html"> the Swagger Web UI</a></strong> to view and interact with the platform's API.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, you can also interact with the platform via HTTP calls, e.g. using <code>curl</code>. For example, to invoke an action of an agent running on the platform, you can use a call like this:
    </p>
    <code>
        curl -X POST http://[host]:[port]/invoke/[NameOfTheAction] -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"[param]": [value], ...}'
    </code>
    <h2>About OPACA</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of OPACA is to combine multi-agent systems with microservices and container-technologies using a
        simple, universal API, build around a set of simple design principles and requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open, Standardized Interfaces</li>
        <li>Being Language Agnostic</li>
        <li>Modularity and Reusability</li>
        <li>Self-Description</li>
        <li>Dynamic Multi-Tenancy</li>
        <li>Distribution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This way, we make it easier to deploy and connect heterogeneous systems consisting of components implemented
        using different agent-frameworks and/or non-agent components in different languages.
        A multi-agent system in the OPACA approach consists of two types of components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Agent Containers</strong> are containerized applications that implement the OPACA Agent Container
            API. They provide REST routes for finding out about the agents within the container, and to interact with
            them by of sending asynchronous messages (unicast and broadcast) and invoking synchronous actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Runtime Platforms</strong> are used to manage one or more Agent Containers, deploying those in
            Docker or Kubernetes. They connect different Agent Containers while also providing basic services such as
            yellow pages, authentication, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>
